An issue can be a

1. **task** - an actionable "thing" that needs to be done on the project.
2. **bug** - a report of non-working behavior related to the project and how you integrate with your appplication.
3. **feature** - a nice-to-have that would improve developer experience when integrating the project with your application.

The issue title should describe what type of issue it is by using a descriptive word or phrase related to the type of issue. It is okay to suggest that an issue is a bug, feature, or task in the title of the task.

Examples:

* "Unable to use on PHP 7.3" describes a **bug** because the software should work on supported versions of PHP.
* "Add an Exception for configuration errors" describes a **feature** request that would help clarify errors when developing with the library.
* "Improve test coverage for private applications" describes a **task** that should be done, but is not a new feature or related to a bug.
